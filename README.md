# Terraform Exercise - Infrastructure as Code

This repository contains an exercise on using Terraform for provisioning infrastructure as code (IaC). In this exercise, I created and managed cloud resources using Terraform's declarative configuration language. This document provides an overview of the project setup, required tools, and steps to run the exercise.

## About Terraform

Terraform (by HashiCorp) is an open-source tool that has transitioned to a business license, meaning it is no longer open source and cannot be forked to design your own version of Terraform. 

### Key Features:
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Terraform enables automated infrastructure management, eliminating the need for manual setup in the console and reducing the likelihood of errors.

### How to Write Terraform:
- **Configuration Language**: Terraform uses HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) for defining infrastructure.

Terraform facilitates the writing and management of infrastructure. 

### Who Manages the Infrastructure?
This is where **Ansible** comes into the picture. Ansible is a configuration management tool that helps manage the configuration of systems built by Terraform.

### What Can We Do with Terraform?
- Manage **Files**
- Manage **Docker**
- Provision **AWS/Azure Resources**
- Deploy **WordPress**

## Prerequisites

Before running the Terraform scripts in this exercise, make sure you have the following:

1. **Terraform**: Install Terraform on your local machine. You can download it from [here](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
2. **Cloud Provider Account**: Ensure you have an active account with a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) and the necessary credentials for provisioning resources.
   - AWS CLI installed and configured (if you're using AWS).

## Important Points 

### How to Write HCL:

```hcl
<block> <parameter> {
    <arguments>
}
```

### First Step:

**Initialize Terraform:**

```bash
terraform init
```

### Second Step:

**Connect Your Cloud Provider:**  
In this example, I am using AWS with Terraform.

1. **Terraform â†’ AWS:** 
   - Set up IAM (Identity and Access Management) with a user that has the necessary credentials.
   
```plaintext
Terraform ---> AWS --- IAM [User with credentials]
  ^                                                    |
  |____________________________________________________|

--> Use user credentials to connect AWS to your local machine
